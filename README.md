# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This Project has been developed and maintained by a group of three students namely, Urvashi Ramdasani (18BCE247), Gunjan Vinzuda (18BCE257) and Shruti Kapadia (18BCE226). As the name suggests, this is a deep learning model which classifies the handwritten digits upto the accuracy of 90%. 

## Description

We have used Artificial Neural Networks from grass root level with 3 layers to implement this model. The architecture of network is defined in Network.py, while the model is being created in test.py file. For running the model, we have gui.py file. 

## Requirements

Kindly refer the requirements.txt file to get the system requirements. The dependencies can be installed as : 
```
pip install *requirement*@*version*
```

## Run the Project

This project can be simply run by typing the following command in console. 
```
python gui.py
```
Note : In case all the dependencies don't work, kindly see the video present to view the actual functioning of our model.
